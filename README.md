## **MGKDB**
MGKDB is a tool for storing, accessing, and learning from a wealth of fusion results.  The main focus of MGKDB will be in the pedestal region of tokamaks, with a large portion of data coming from simulation results.  Currently, GENE is the only code compatible with the database, though compatibility with more codes will be added in the future.
```python
MGKDB is written in Python 3.6
